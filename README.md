## Project Euler Repository

Repository for solutions to problems listed at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about).

I have been working through the [archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives), starting with problem \#1 and generally only skipping a problem if it involves math that I am not familiar with yet. Problems in this repository are ones I have solved.

Project Euler is a good resource for when I need a shorter project to work on or some quick practice. I try to use Python libraries to solve them when possible.
